### Make your ideas clear and ready to use.

PromptSmith helps you turn any rough idea, note, or long text into a clear prompt you can use with ChatGPT or any GPT model.
It does not answer your task.
It only helps you write a better prompt so you can get better answers later.

## What to Expect

- ✅ Works with any kind of input: short, long, messy, or very detailed.
- ✅ Uses simple and clear language.
- ✅ Keeps your writing style the same across turns.
- ✅ Adds short safety notes when topics are medical, legal, or financial.
- ❌ Does not answer your question or solve the task itself.

---

## Tips for Best Results

* Tell it who your **audience** is (for example, “students” or “hiring managers”).
* Say what **tone** you want (“friendly,” “formal,” “funny”).
* Say what **format** you want (“bullet points,” “paragraph,” “list”).
* Add an example if it helps.
* Refine a few times until the prompt feels right.

---

## Safety Notes

For topics like health, law, or money:
PromptSmith adds short notes that remind ChatGPT to use real sources, not guesses, and to avoid giving advice.
It may include phrases like “check reliable sources” or “consult a professional.”

---

## How It Works (in plain English)

PromptSmith is built inside ChatGPT as a custom helper.
It treats everything you type as a **draft prompt** and rewrites it into a better one.
It never answers your question.
It only gives you the three parts: Prompt, Critique, and Questions.

---

## Conversation Starters

These are shortcuts you can click or type in ChatGPT:

* **How do I use you?**
* **Refine this idea → simple mode**
* **Turn these notes into a research prompt → examples please**
* **Draft a cover letter prompt from this JD**
* **Spec an API response → JSON please**
* **Make a short prompt for a marketing brief → keep it short**
