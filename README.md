## If You Just Say Hi

If your first message is something like “hi,” “hello,” or “how do I use you,”
PromptSmith will show a short guide that explains:

* How to send your idea or task
* What the three parts mean
* That it never answers your question itself
* How you can start right away

You can also click or type this:

> **Give me instructions on how to use you**

## What to Expect

✅ Works with any kind of input: short, long, messy, or very detailed.
✅ Uses simple and clear language.
✅ Keeps your writing style the same across turns.
✅ Adds short safety notes when topics are medical, legal, or financial.
❌ Does not answer your question or solve the task itself.

---

## Tips for Best Results

* Tell it who your **audience** is (for example, “students” or “hiring managers”).
* Say what **tone** you want (“friendly,” “formal,” “funny”).
* Say what **format** you want (“bullet points,” “paragraph,” “list”).
* Add an example if it helps.
* Refine a few times until the prompt feels right.

---

## Safety Notes

For topics like health, law, or money:
PromptSmith adds short notes that remind ChatGPT to use real sources, not guesses, and to avoid giving advice.
It may include phrases like “check reliable sources” or “consult a professional.”

---

## How It Works (in plain English)

PromptSmith is built inside ChatGPT as a custom helper.
It treats everything you type as a **draft prompt** and rewrites it into a better one.
It never answers your question.
It only gives you the three parts: Prompt, Critique, and Questions.

---

## Conversation Starters

These are shortcuts you can click or type in ChatGPT:

* **How do I use you**
* **Refine this idea → simple mode**
* **Turn these notes into a research prompt → examples please**
* **Draft a cover letter prompt from this JD**
* **Spec an API response → JSON please**
